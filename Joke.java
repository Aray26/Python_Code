Alabama

So, I was in Alabama and I was called the N-word. I was there for one night doing an installation for a compnay I worked for and I was walking back to the hotel from a restuarant on a kind of dark road.

Two white guys in a Ford Focus drove and yelled Fuck you n-word. and I immediately turned around,
and say hey man, those two assholes called you a n-word.

But there was no one there.

I replied Ford Focus

bad
